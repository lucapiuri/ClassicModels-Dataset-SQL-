For this project I have set up a MySQL server on my machine, and I'm interacting with it via MySQL Workbench, VS Code and the Ubuntu CLI.

I have created a database with the necessary tables, defined their schemas and relations, and loaded the data into them.

Once the relational database has been defined, I answered to some business questions by querying the database.
