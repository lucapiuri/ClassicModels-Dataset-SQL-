# ClassicModels-Dataset-SQL-
Exploration of "ClassicModels" dataset with SQL queries

Classic Models Inc. is a manufacturer of small scale models of cars, motorcycles, planes, ships trains etc. Products manufactured by Classic Models are sold in toy & gift stores around the world.
Classic Models has offices around the world with dozens of employees. The customers of Classic Models are typically toy/gift stores. Each customer has a designated sales representative (an employee of Classic Models) they interact with. Customers typically place orders requesting several products in different quantities and pay for multiple orders at once via cheques.

We will first create a database to record and manage all of the above information and to run day-to-day operations (adding customers, placing orders, recording payments, hiring employees etc)

Then, once the relational database has been set up, we will query it to answer business questions. 

I have set up a MySQL server on my machine, and I'm interacting with it via MySQL Workbench, VS Code and the Ubuntu CLI.
